# GameProject_OOP
C++
A console game including different characters. Each one of them has its own powers.
There are three game modes - all vs. all, direct eliminations and mixed fight. The outcoming results of the game are being serialized in text files.
I also included some things that make the game more interesting - for example weapons and shields, which can be randomly allocated.
I started working on some kind of boss fights, but it isn`t still finished yet.
